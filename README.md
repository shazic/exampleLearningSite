# Learning Website example

This is an exampe website created to demonstrate the use of the theme [Learner][theme].  
  
This theme could be used with [Hugo][hugo] to create a blog cum training website.  

## Limitations
Since the theme is developed using Hugo, it would only be a static website. This means anyone can visit and view the courses if they can access the URL.  
If authentication and authorization is required for the website, then you may do any of the following:  
1. The website could be hosted as an internal website to restrict the who can see the content.
1. Use the [Serverless framework][sls] along with the website created statically by Hugo.
